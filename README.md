> - Data mining is an **`interdisciplinary`** (intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems) **field of knowledge**. 
> - Many people treat data mining as a **synonym for knowledge discovery from data**, or **`KDD`**, while others view data mining as **merely** an essential **`step` in the process of KDD** where intelligent methods are applied to **`extract data patterns`**. 
> - As in **industries and in the academic environment** the term data mining is often used to refer to the **`entire knowledge discovery process`** weâ€™ll **adopt this broader view of data mining**.

### Dataset:
&rarr; The data is a subset of publicly available (from https://www.meteoblue.com/) data about climate in Basel, Switzerland, which contains 1763 records of data (for 18 features) from the summer and the winter seasons from 2010 to 2019 period.

&rarr; The meaning of each column of data is listed in the notebook.

### Tasks:
&rarr; **PRE-PROCESSSING**
- EDA 
    - Descriptive statistics
    - Check if there is any null data
    - Histograms of all variables and correlation between all features 
- Feature Selection (considering the conclusions drawn from EDA)
- Standardize 
- Detect Global Outliers (if < -3 or >3)
- Normalize (to convert to [0, 1])
- Feature Extraction with **`PCA`** (extraction of new, orthogonal - independent - features, which are a linear combination of the original ones)
- PCA Features Contribution to Cumulative Explained Variance

&rarr; **CLASSIFICATION**
- **`Classification`** with **`K-NN`** and **`SVM`**, using **`Hyperparameter Tuning`** with  **`GridSeachCV`**
