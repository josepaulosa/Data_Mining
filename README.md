> - Data mining is an **`interdisciplinary`** (intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems) **field of knowledge**. 
> - Many people treat data mining as a **synonym for knowledge discovery from data**, or **`KDD`**, while others view data mining as **merely** an essential **`step` in the process of KDD** where intelligent methods are applied to **`extract data patterns`**. 
> - As in **industries and in the academic environment** the term data mining is often used to refer to the **`entire knowledge discovery process`** weâ€™ll **adopt this broader view of data mining**.
